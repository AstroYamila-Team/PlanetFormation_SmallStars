# PlanetFormation_SmallStars

Code and files published in Stefansson et al. 2023. Code developed in Miguel et al. 2020. If you use this code, please cite those two papers.

To compile the code you can use any standadr fortran compiler. The one I used is gfortran (option -o).
To obtain the results published in Stefansson et al. change the mass of the star and the disk mass according to the conditions described in the paper for each of the cases explored. 
The parameters for the distribution of mass of the disk can also change. All description can be found in detail on the Supplementary material of Steffanson et al.
